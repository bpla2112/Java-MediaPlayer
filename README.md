Java-MediaPlayer

**Summary**
Simple media player. It will probably initialize by playing a video called ducktales.mp4
However, one can choose to play music or other videos using the Open Dialog.

**Build Information**
This project was built using Java 1.8. I highly recommend using 1.8 because the JavaFX libraries are easily accessible.
If you want, you can try to build it in Java 9. However, you may come across issues during the compilation process stemming from JavaFX.

**Next Steps**
I would like to build an installer package and make this media player more aesthetically pleasing.
Maybe give the player a name, or an icon when it loads.
